# Jan Task v1

Things I learned with this project

  - Used AJAX to pull an API from GettyImages
  - learned how to bind in js
  - took class on React (for later projects, not in this one)
  - utlized Flexbox in a realworld setting

Bugs

  - Safari and button CSS are messed up, researching the issue
  - Delete/Edit buttons are a litle temperamental - enough to warrant my attention
